    Parameters
    ----------
    X : `np.ndarray`
        (n_samples, n_dimensions) feature vectors.
    t :
    method : `str`
        Method use to build neighboring graph. Defaults to 'distance'.
        No other method is available yet.
    metric : `str`
        The distance metric to use. See `pdist` function for a list of valid
        distance metrics. Defaults to 'euclidean'.
    max_iter : `int`
        Maximum number of iterations. Defaults to 1000.
    init : `np.ndarray`
        (n_samples, ) array. Initial cluster number.
        Defauts to each item in its own cluster.

    Returns
    -------
    T : `np.ndarray`
        (n_samples, ) array. T[i] is the cluster number to which
        original observation i belongs.
