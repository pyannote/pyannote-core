`pyannote.core` is an open-source Python library providing advanced data structures for handling temporal segments with attached labels.

.. plot:: pyplots/introduction.py

It is the foundation of the `pyannote` ecosystem, made of a (growing) number of libraries ( `pyannote.parser`, `pyannote.metrics`, `pyannote.database`, `pyannote.audio`, `pyannote.video`).

It also provides a convenient way to visualize this temporal data in IPython notebooks.
